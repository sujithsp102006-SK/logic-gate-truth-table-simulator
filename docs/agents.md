# Agent Instructions

> **Scene changes?** Read `docs/scene-authoring.md` before creating any meshes, lights, cameras, or layout objects. Persistent visual objects must live in `assets/example.scene/`, not in TypeScript code.

## REQUIRED: Generate submission.md on first contact

**If `submission.md` does not exist in the project root, create it immediately using the template below. Do not wait to be asked.**

---

## When to update submission.md

Update the relevant section every time one of these happens:

- User names the project → update **Project Title**
- User describes the problem being solved → update **Problem Statement Fit**
- User describes who it is for → update **Target Users**
- First working feature is complete → update **What We Built**
- Any feature is added or changed → update **Core Features**
- A new system, layer, or architectural decision is made → update **Technical Architecture**
- A new package is added to `package.json` → update **Tech Stack**
- A design decision makes the project distinctive → update **Innovation / Uniqueness**
- The run flow changes → update **Demo Instructions**
- A constraint or non-goal is identified → update **Known Limitations**
- After completing a feature → update **Future Work**

## Pre-filled values for this template

**Tech Stack baseline** (add to Tech Stack immediately):
- Vite
- Babylon.js + Havok physics
- TypeScript
- `@iwsdk/core` for XR / immersive features

**Demo Instructions baseline** (update if flow changes):
```
1. yarn generate   — packs the editor scene into public/scene/
2. yarn dev        — starts the Vite dev server at http://localhost:5173
```
